# For the most recent release you can find the files conveniently zipped [here under "assets"](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensor3dPrintableCase/releases)

This folder contains the stl files for convenience. It is recommended however to download the latest released files as a zipped bundle [here under "assets"](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensor3dPrintableCase/releases) instead.

> **Warning**
> We only keep the rail shapes constant between versions. When printing make sure that your MainCase and Lid as well as DisplayCase Top and Bottom come from the same case version. The Idea is that OpenBikeSensors can be mounted on a different bike with older mounts, but the current version lid won't necessarily fit onto last years case.
